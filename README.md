# A Recipe API

This API is a small project of mine to demonstrate my ability to make REST API's using the Django REST Framework. Alongside this it demonstrates a number of other skills such as:

- Docker
- Continuous Integration (Travis CI)
- Test Driven Development

# Outcomes

- Created a fully-functional REST API using Django REST Framework
- Setup a project using Docker
- Configure Travis-CI
- Create endpoints
- Listing and filtering
- Upload images
- A lot of unit tests

# What you can do with this API

You are able to create recipes by adding ingredients and a picture. Also create tags such as "Vegan" to associate your recipes. Users can do this by signing up to the application and also logging in with their account.

Feel free to try out
